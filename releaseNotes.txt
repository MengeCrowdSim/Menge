Release 0.8.2
	October 17, 2016
	
	New Features
		Added new plugin: StressGAS
			Action for inducing stress upon agents.  Provided two examples: time based and distance based with corresponding examples.
		Added project for VS2013
		Added navigation mesh agent placement.  For multi-layered navigation meshes, a 2D position can be placed on specific polygon groups (rather than the top-down projection default behavior.)  This allows for population of multiple overlapping layers.
		Refactored Goals to use a common region class and operations.
		
	Clean up
		Graph parsing made more verbose; errors in the graph now write to the log and program exits gracefully.
		Obstacles
			Removed unused "boundingbox" attribute in XML obstacle definition.
			Open obstacles are now rejected.
		Fixed .gitignore to properly ignore VS2005 build artifacts
		
	Bugs
		NavMesh spatial query uses agent polygon position to search for polygons; previously it ignored this information and would, in some cases, produce incorrect sets of neigbhor obstacles.
		Fixed bug which prevented scb creation in linux
