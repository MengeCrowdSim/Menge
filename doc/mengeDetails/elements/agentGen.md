Agent Generators {#page_AgentGen}

@section sec_AG_overview Overview

As the name suggest, an Agent Generator, generates agents.  It is responsible for determining the
total number of agents in the `<AgentGroup>` and their positions.  In addition to whatever
parameters the particular generator requires, all generators can be use a *noise* parameter.
The calculated agent position can be perturbed by a noise generator.

The noise generation is a simple displacement of the computed agent position.  The direction of
displacement is random with all directions equally likely.  The magnitude of displacement is
defined by the given distribution (more details can be seen in the documentation for the
[AgentGenerator](@ref Menge::Agents::AgentGenerator) class).

There are two important methods for an implementation of an AgentGenerator to implement:
[agentCount](@ref Menge::Agents::AgentGenerator::agentCount) and
[setAgentPosition](@ref Menge::Agents::AgentGenerator::setAgentPosition).

[agentCount](@ref Menge::Agents::AgentGenerator::agentCount) reports the number of agents that will
be created based on the parameters in the XML specification.  

[setAgentPosition](@ref Menge::Agents::AgentGenerator::setAgentPosition) takes as a parameter the index of one
of the generated agents (it should lie in the range [0, N) where N is the value returned by
[agentCount](@ref Menge::Agents::AgentGenerator::agentCount) and the agent to be placed.

@subsection subsec_AG_implementations Implementations

This version of Menge includes the following implementations of the agent generator:

- The [explicit generator](@ref Menge::Agents::ExplicitGenerator).  
- The [rectangular grid generator](@ref Menge::Agents::RectGridGenerator).
- The [hexagonal lattice generator](@ref Menge::Agents::HexLatticeGenerator).
- The [explicit navigation mesh generator](@ref Menge::Agents::NavMeshGenerator).
	
See the class documentation for details on their semantics and how to instantiate this profile
selector.

Future versions of Menge will include profile selectors which can operate on sets of profiles,
e.g., assigning profiles randomly or based on weighted distributions.
