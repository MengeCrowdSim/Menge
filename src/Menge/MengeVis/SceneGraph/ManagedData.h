	//
	// To use them the derived class needs to satisfy the following requirements:
	//	1. The class, Data,  must have a PUBLIC static member: std::map< std::string, TData * >
	//		This class is a map that maps filenames to pointers to the corresponding loaded
	//		data.  If the filename is not a key in this map, then the data has never been loaded
	//	2. You must provide a function: Data * readData( const std::string )
	//		This function constructs a new Data, reads the file and populates the data file,
	//		ADDS THE DATA FILE TO THE MAP, and returns the pointer to the data.
	//	3. The wrapper class, T, must instantiate using TData * as the only argument with the
	//		constructor.
	//
	// If I do this, then any final user can simply call "T * myT = loadT( fileName );"  And get
	//		a pointer to the data contained in the fileName which prevents duplicate loading and
	//		automatically tracks references so when all the T's that reference a particular TData
	//		are destroyed.
