	 *	are refreshed when the OpenGL context changes.  
	 *
	 *	Each resource registers a refresh callback  to the manager and then the viewer, when 
	 *	changin GL Contexts, calls newGLContext() to have the resources update.
	 *
	 *	If any new resources are added to the SceneGraph which have OpenGL-dependent memory
	 *	(such as textures, display lists, arrays of data, etc.) that class must provide
	 *	a static callback method and register it so its data can be restored in the new
	 *	context (e.g. ImageData, Circle, Cylinder, etc.).
