 *	are refreshed when the OpenGL context changes.
 *
 *	Each resource registers a refresh callback  to the manager and then the viewer, when
 *	changin GL Contexts, calls newGLContext() to have the resources update.
 *
 *	If any new resources are added to the SceneGraph which have OpenGL-dependent memory
 *	(such as textures, display lists, arrays of data, etc.) that class must provide
 *	a static callback method and register it so its data can be restored in the new
 *	context (e.g. ImageData, Circle, Cylinder, etc.).
