 *
 *	Required parameters:
 *		- Scene specification
 *		- Behavior specification
 *		- Model name
 *
 *	Optional parameters (with defaults):
 *		- Interactive flag (false)
 *		- View specification (None -- no interactive view if interactive flag is false)
 *		- Output trajectory file name (None -- no output)
 *		- Trajectory version (2.1)
 *		- Simulation duration limit (400 s)
 *		- Simulation time step (use time step in scene specification)
 *		- Display verbose progress (false)
 *		- Random seed argument (0)
