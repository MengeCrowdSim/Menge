		 *	A state node in the finite state machine for determining "behaviors".

		 *	State's can also include actions, taken on an agent when it leaves the
		 *	state and an optional corresponding action upon leaving the state (see Action).
		 *	Agents leave the state based on transitions (see Transition).
		 *
		 *	State's can be marked as "final".  Agents *can* transition out of final
		 *	states.  However, in any given time step, when all agents are in final states
		 *	the simulation stops.
