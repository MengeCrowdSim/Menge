 *	@file		Action.h
 *	@brief		The definition of actions that are taken as agents enter states.
 *
 *	Actions are associated with behavior states.  When an agent enters the corresponding
 *	behavior state, the action is taken on the agent.  It is typically used to modify
 *	agent parameters, consistent with what the state represents.  By default the agent
 *	should restore the agents parameter values when the agent leaves the FSM state.
 *	However, a flag can deactivate this behavior.
