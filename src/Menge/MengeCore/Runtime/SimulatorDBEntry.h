	 *	@brief		An entry in the simulator database.
	 *
	 *	Every pedestrian model must define and register a SimulatorDBEntry.
	 *	The entry provides brief and long descriptions of the pedestrian 
	 *	model to display in response to command-line queries.  Furthermore,
	 *	they are responsible for instantiating simulators, behavior FSM,
	 *	and SimSystem (although, this is done in the base class and <i>not</i>
	 *	the derived classes.
	 *
	 *	A derived class should do the following:
	 *		- Inherit from the SimulatorDBEntry
	 *		- Implement the following functions:
	 *			- SimulatorDBEntry::briefDescription
	 *			- SimulatorDBEntry::longDescription
	 *			- SimulatorDBEntry::viewName
	 *			- SimulatorDBEntry::commandLineName
	 *			- SimulatorDBEntry::getNewSimulator
	 *		- Optionally implement the following functionsl
	 *			- SimulatorDBEntry::contextFromSystem if the pedestrian model provides
	 *			a unique sub-class of Agents::BaseAgentContext.
	 *			- SimulatorDBEntry::getAgentInitalizer if the pedestrian model has
	 *			custom per-agent attributes to parse (in addition to the common parameters).
