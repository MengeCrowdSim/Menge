		 *	@brief		The base class for determining an agent's elevation.
		 *
		 *	This is an abstract class, primarily defining the Elevation abstraction.
		 *	Essentially, the Elevation object must be able to report elevation for
		 *	an agent (or an arbitrary position) and the "gradient" at that point.
		 *
		 *	The gradient is not *truly* the gradient.  In fact, it is merely the 
		 *	projection of the elevation object's normal on the planning plane.  So,
		 *	if the elevation is parallel to the planning plane, the gradient would be
		 *	the vector \<0, 0\>.  If the elevation surface is perpendicular to the
		 *	planning plane (a highly unlikely contingent) it would be the vector \<x, y\>
		 *	such that the magnitude of that vector is 1.
