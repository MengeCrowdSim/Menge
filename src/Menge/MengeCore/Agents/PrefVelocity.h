		 *
		 *	The preferred velocity is actually a space of velocities defined
		 *	by two things:
		 *		- a preferred speed
		 *		- a *span* of directions.
		 *	The span of directions represents a contiguous set of directions which
		 *	can be considered topologically equivalent with respect to the agent
		 *	reaching its goal.
		 *
		 *	For example, the shortest path may require an agent to pass down a hall way,
		 *	but whether the agent walks down the left, middle, or side is irrelevant -- all
		 *	three will get the agent to its final goal with negligible difference.
