 *  @brief      A spatial query object based on Jur van den Berg's <i>k</i>d-tree as defined
 *				in the RVO2 library (http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/RVO2).
 *
 *	This spatial query implementation uses a <i>k</i>d-tree for agents and a bsp-tree for
 *	obstacles.  The BSP Tree changes the input obstacle set.  Single line segments can end
 *	up cut into two or more pieces.  This *may* have a deleterious effect on simulation.
