 *	@brief		The definition of the Generalized Centrifugal Force pedestrian plug-in.
 *
 *	This is inspired by the paper by Chraibi et al (Generalized Centrifugal Force model.
 *	However, the implementation differs in several critical ways:
 *
 *		1) The "facing" direction is not simply the moving direction.  In fact, this
 *		   model has a unique computation for orientation based on its movement
 *		   speed.
 *		2) Rather than having a facing direction that simply cuts off at 90 degrees
 *		   to the side of the facing direction, forces are generated for agents in
 *		   all directions, however, the magnitudes of those forces is modulated by
 *		   how near the facing direction the neighbor is -- the closer to directly
 *		   in front, the larger the force.
 *		3) The repulsion force is maxed out at 3X the user-specified maximum agent
 *		   force.  To insure a well-behaved response function, the interpolation
 *		   width is constrained such that the response force only grows monotonically.
 *		4) The magnitude of the velocity scale (v_ij) is not the dot product of the
 *		   relative velocity and orientation, but of the velocity and the *force*
 *		   direction.  Essentially, this factor goes to zero if the agents are already
 *		   diverging.  Only if the agents are *converging* does this factor increase.
