	/*!
	 *	@brief		An action that configures an agent to become stressed based on proximity to
	 *				a region.
	 *				
	 *	When the action is applied to an agent, the agent's stress level is related to its
	 *	distance to a defined region.  Within a specified distance to the region, the stress
	 *	is at 100%.  As the agent moves away from the stress region, the stress level is lower 
	 *	until at a maximum range, the region imparts no stress on the agent.
	 *	
	 *	How the imparted stress varies with respect to the distance depends on the stress 
	 *	function defined in the DistanceStressFuction @see DistanceStressFuction.  But more 
	 *	particularly, when the agent has achieved a certain amount of stress and then moves
	 *	*away* from the stress region, his stress level does not directly fall.  The rate at which
	 *	the stress level falls is a function of the cool down rate of the basic stress Action.
	 *	
	 *	For example, if the agent moves close to the stress region, the peakstress level may reach 
	 *	90%.  And then, if the agent moves quickly away, to a region that would ordinarily only
	 *	invoke 20% stress, the agent's actual stress level would be:
	 *	
	 *		max( 0.2, 0.9 - (\delta t / cool down duration) )
	 *	
	 *	XML Example:
	 *	```
	 *	<Action type="distance_stress"
	 *		exit_behavior={"reset"|"continue"|"pause"|"cool down"}
	 *		min_distance_dist="c|n|u" ...
	 *		max_distance_dist="c|n|u" ...
	 *		fall_off={"linear"|"quadratic"}
	 *		shape={"point"|"circle"|"AABB"|"OBB"}
	 *		[shape parameters]
	 *	/>
	 *	```
	 *	
	 *	The DistanceStressAction introduces several new parameters:
	 *	- `min_distance` - the distance from the region at which the induced stress level is 100%.  
	 *	- `max_distance` - the ditance from the region at which no stress is induced.  
	 *	- `shape` - the type of region that induces stress.  Depending on the type, additional  
	 *	  parameters will be required to defined the shape's size and position.
