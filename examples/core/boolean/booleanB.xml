		Second transtion out of ChangeSpeed
			- it is evaluated after the previous (because it is defined second).
			- If the previous condition was NOT met, it is either because the goal wasn't reached, or it
				wasn't reached fast enough.
			- If it was a case of timing, this condition will be met (at goal), the agent will be filtered
				in the slow direction.
